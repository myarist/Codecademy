"""
In data science, probability is often used to simulate 
scenarios. The code on the right simulates the birthday 
problem. Right now the code simulates a room with only 
2 people that get random birthdays, and the probability 
that those 2 people have the same birthday is really low.
Change the number 2 to a higher number of your choosing 
where it says #Change This Number and run the code.
Is there a match in the simulation? Whatâ€™s the probability 
that there would be a match? Keep changing the number 
to test out different simulations.
