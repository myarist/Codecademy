## **2. Getting Started with Data Science**

<details><summary>Details</summary>

### **a. Introduction to Data Science**

Data science enables us to take data and transform it into meaningful information that can help us make decisions. Data science is interdisciplinary and combines other well-known fields such as probability, statistics, analytics, and computer science. The work that you might do could range from writing up reports to building machine learning models. No matter what your interests are, data science is applicable - because these days, we have data on everything!

<p align="center">
  <img src="Data%20Scientist%20Career%20Path\2.%20Getting Started%20with%20Data%20Science\Data%20Science%20Venn%20Diagram.png" width="500px">
</p>

#### **1) Statistics**

A fundamental part of data science is statistics. Statistics is the practice of applying mathematical calculations to sets of data to derive meaning. Statistics can give us a quick summary of a dataset, such as the average amount or how consistent a dataset is.

There are two types of statistics: 

- **Descriptive Statistics**

    Descriptive statistics describe a dataset using mathematically calculated values, such as the mean and standard deviation. For instance, the graph below from [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/heres-what-the-gender-pay-gap-looks-like-by-income-level/) charts the wage gap between American men and women in 2014. An example of a descriptive statistic would be that at the 90th income percentile, women make 80.6% of what men make on average.

- **Inferential Statistics**

    On the other hand, inferential statistics are statistical calculations that enable us to draw conclusions about the larger population. For instance, from looking at the graph we can infer that at the 99th income percentile, women make less than 78% of what men make on average. We can also infer that the reason why the wage gap is smallest at the 10th income percentile is because the minimum wage for men and women is the same.

#### **2) Probability**

Another field that informs the field of data science is probability. Probability is the mathematical study of what could potentially happen. Fun fact: the study of probability came about as a method to decode secret messages.

In data science, probability calculations are used to build models. Models are able to help us understand data that has yet to exist - either data we hadn‚Äôt previously collected or data that has yet to be created. Data scientists create models to help calculate the probability of a certain action and then they use that probability to make informed decisions.

[Example of Probability Application](Data%20Scientist%20Career%20Path\2.%20Getting%20Started%20with%20Data%20Science\1.%20Introduction%20to%20Data%20Science\probability.py)

#### **3) Programming**

Given that we‚Äôre a ‚Äúlearn to code‚Äù website, this one may seem fairly obvious. But in all seriousness, programming is an essential part of data science. It‚Äôs also what sets data science apart from similar fields, like data analytics.

Programming is the practice of writing commands for a computer to execute. Computer Science is the discipline of interacting with computation systems.

[Example of Programming Application](Data%20Scientist%20Career%20Path\2.%20Getting%20Started%20with%20Data%20Science\1.%20Introduction%20to%20Data%20Science\programming.py)

#### **4) Domain Expertise**

One of the reasons that data science is one of the most interesting fields to go into is that it doesn‚Äôt limit you to a specific industry. Interested in airplanes? Work for a company on ticket pricing! Like fashion? Create a model that predicts the latest trends.

<p align="center">
  <img src="Data%20Scientist%20Career%20Path\2.%20Getting%20Started%20with%20Data%20Science\Domain.svg">
</p>

Domain Expertise refers to the particular set of knowledge that someone cultivates in order to understand their data. You may be able to crunch the numbers, but in order to understand their meaning, you‚Äôre going to need a lot of context. Sometimes this context comes from your research, your teammates, or the knowledge that you gain after working in a particular industry.

#### **Review**

Review! You now know the basic parts that make up the field of data science.

- Data Science‚Äîthe field of taking data and transforming it into meaningful information that can help us make decisions
- Descriptive Statistics‚Äîstatistics that describe the data in objective terms
- Inferential Statistics‚Äîinferences for the overall population based on data
- Probability‚Äîthe likelihood that an event will happen
- Programming‚Äîthe act of giving the computer instructions to perform a task
- Domain Expertise‚Äîthe particular set of knowledge that someone cultivates and brings with them in order to understand their data

  <img src="Data%20Scientist%20Career%20Path\2.%20Getting%20Started%20with%20Data%20Science\Data%20Science%20Process%20Diagram.webp">
</p>

### **c. Data Science Applications**

As you can see, there are many different applications and kinds of projects that you can do once you know a bit of data science!

- Reports - a way of presenting your process, insights, and recommendations
- Recommender Systems - a process that uses data about users and items to predict interest
- Dynamic Pricing - a strategy that takes into account factors such as demand to increase and decrease prices to drive profit
- Natural Language Processing - ways of analyzing text to gain insights as well as support applications, such as chatbots

Of course, there are many applications beyond just the ones that we‚Äôve covered here. So no matter your interest or professional industry, data science thinking can create impact.

Two common errors that we encounter while writing Python are `SyntaxError` and `NameError`.

- `SyntaxError` means there is something wrong with the way your program is written ‚Äî punctuation that does not belong, a command where it is not expected, or a missing parenthesis can all trigger a `SyntaxError`.

- A `NameError` occurs when the Python interpreter sees a word it does not recognize. Code that contains something that looks like a variable but was never defined will throw a `NameError`.

#### **Documentation**

[Python Documentation - Built-in Types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html)

In this documentation, you will learn about the built-in data types of Python. This is helpful if you would like to learn about data types that you can use when programming in Python.

### **b. Python Functions**

<details><summary>Details</summary>

Let‚Äôs imagine we were building an application to help people plan trips! When using a trip planning application we can say a simple procedure could look like this:

```
 1. Establish your origin and destination
 2. Calculate the distance/route
 3. Return the best route to the user
```

We will perform these three steps every time users have to travel between two points using our trip application. In our programs, we could rewrite the same procedures over and over (and over) for each time we want to travel, but there‚Äôs a better way! Python gives us a useful concept called *functions*.

Here‚Äôs an example of a function definition:

```
def function_name():
    # functions tasks go here
```

There are some key components we want to note here:
- The `def` keyword indicates the beginning of a function (also known as a function header). The function header is followed by a name in snake_case format that describes the task the function performs. It‚Äôs best practice to give your functions a descriptive yet concise name.

- Following the function name is a pair of parenthesis `( )` that can hold input values known as parameters (more on parameters later in the lesson!). In this example function, we have no parameters.

- A colon `:` to mark the end of the function header.

- Lastly, we have one or more valid python statements that make up the function body (where we have our python comment).

Let‚Äôs review what we‚Äôve learned this lesson:

- Boolean expressions are statements that can be either `True` or `False`
- A boolean variable is a variable that is set to either `True` or `False`.
- We can create boolean expressions using relational operators:
    - `==` : Equals
    - `!=` : Not equals
    - `>` : Greater than
    - `>=` : Greater than or equal to
    - `<` : Less than
    - `<=` : Less than or equal to
- `if` statements can be used to create control flow in your code.
- `else` statements can be used to execute code when the conditions of an `if` statement are not met.
- `elif` statements can be used to build additional checks into your `if` statements

### **d. Getting Started Off-Platform**

<details><summary>Details</summary>

#### **1) Command Line Interface Setup**

Windows has a different CLI, called Command Prompt. While this has many of the same features as Bash, Bash is much more popular. Because of the strength of the open source community and the tools they provide, mastering Bash is a better investment than mastering Command Prompt.

To use Bash on a Windows computer, we will download and install a program called Git Bash. Git Bash allows us to easily access Bash as well as another tool we‚Äôll be using later called Git, inside the Windows environment.

For more detailed tutorial, please watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQY0g7s2hac).

#### **2) Introducing Jupyter Notebook**

Jupyter Notebook (sometimes called IPython Notebook) is a popular way to write and run Python code, especially for data analysis, data science and machine learning. Jupyter Notebooks are easy-to-use because they let you execute code and review the output quickly. This iterative process is central to data analytics and makes it easy to test hypotheses and record the results (just like a notebook).

<p align="center">
  <img src="Data%20Scientist%20Career%20Path\3.%20Python%20Fundamentals\4.%20Getting%20Started%20Off-Platform\jupyter.gif">
</p>

Above is the Jupyter Notebook interface. A Jupyter Notebook has two parts:

- the front-end interface (what you see in the gif)
- the back-end kernel

The `front-end interface` loads in a web browser and consists of ‚Äúcells‚Äù where you enter your code. The browser is just for display, so you do not need to be connected to the internet.

Jupyter Notebook uses a `back-end kernel` called `IPython`. The ‚ÄòI‚Äô stands for ‚ÄòInteractive‚Äô, which means that a program or script can be broken up into smaller pieces, and those pieces can be run independently from the rest of the program.

You do not need to worry about the difference between `Python` and `IPython`. The important thing to know is that you can run small pieces of code, which can be helpful when working with data.

#### **3) Setting up Jupyter Notebook**

**Windows Anaconda**

Go to the [Anaconda Downloads page](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads) and download the appropriate version of Anaconda (32- or 64-Bit Graphical Installer)

1. Double click on the **.exe** file and click `Install`.
2. Read and agree to the licensing terms.
3. Select if you want to install for 'Just Me' or 'All Users'. If you are installing for 'All Users', you must have Administrator privileges.
4. You will be prompted to select the installation location. By default, Anaconda should try to install in your home directory. We recommend accepting this default. Click `Install`.
5. You will be asked if you want to add Anaconda to your PATH environment variable. Do not add Anaconda to the PATH because it can interfere with other software.
6. You will be asked if you want Anaconda to be your default version of Python. We recommend 'Yes'. There are some rare instances where you might not make Anaconda the default version, but they are beyond the scope of this article.
7. Click the Install button.
8. Go ahead and finish the installation.

Now you can verify your installation. Go to the Windows Start menu and search for ‚ÄòAnaconda Navigator‚Äô (not the Anaconda Prompt).

<p align="center">
  <img src="Data%20Scientist%20Career%20Path\3.%20Python%20Fundamentals\4.%20Getting%20Started%20Off-Platform\logo.png" height='100px'>
</p>

If it appears, it is installed. Congratulations!

Double click on it, and the Anaconda Navigator window should appear.

<p align="center">
  <img src="Data%20Scientist%20Career%20Path\3.%20Python%20Fundamentals\4.%20Getting%20Started%20Off-Platform\anaconda.webp">
</p>

Your applications screen may look slightly different from this one, but that is ok. Click the Launch button under Jupyter Notebook. A Jupyter Notebook interface will appear in your default browser.

<p align="center">
  <img src="Data%20Scientist%20Career%20Path\3.%20Python%20Fundamentals\4.%20Getting%20Started%20Off-Platform\jupyter.webp">
</p>

An Anaconda Prompt might also open and display a url. If it does, do not close it until you are done working with Jupyter Notebook. If it does not appear, don‚Äôt worry - this has to do with your operating system and will not affect Jupyter Notebook‚Äôs performance.

Congratulations!! You are ready to move on to the next article and get started using Jupyter Notebook!

#### **4) Getting Started with Jupyter**

For many more helpful tools and features, check out [the documentation](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html), and if you want to be inspired to do more with Jupyter notebook, check out [A gallery of interesting Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-Jupyter-Notebooks).

Have fun coding with Jupyter Notebook!

#### **5) Getting More out of Jupyter Notebook**

There are numerous ways to enhance your Jupyter Notebook and make it more readable and standardized. We have covered some of the methods, but there are many others that can be found in the [Jupyter Notebook User‚Äôs Manual](https://jupyter.brynmawr.edu/services/public/dblank/Jupyter%20Notebook%20Users%20Manual.ipynb).

**Documentation**

[Jupyter Notebook Documentation](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

In this documentation, you will learn about how to install, configure, and use Jupyter Notebook for Python programming. This is helpful if you would like to quickly validate Python code or prototype visualizations.

### **e. Python List**

<details><summary>Details</summary>

In programming, it is common to want to work with collections of data. In Python, a list is one of the many built-in [data structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure) that allows us to work with a collection of data in sequential order.

Suppose we want to make a list of the heights of students in a class:

- Noelle is 61 inches tall
- Ava is 70 inches tall
- Sam is 67 inches tall
- Mia is 64 inches tall

In Python, we can create a variable called heights to store these integers into a list:

```
heights = [61, 70, 67, 64]
```

Notice that:

1. A list begins and ends with square brackets `([` and `])`.
2. Each item (i.e., `67` or `70`) is separated by a comma (,)
3. It‚Äôs considered good practice to insert a space `()` after each comma, but your code will run just fine if you forget the space.

**Combining Lists: The Zip Function**

Use `zip()` to create a new variable called `names_and_dogs_names` that combines owners and dogs_names lists into a zip object.

Then, create a new variable named `list_of_names_and_dogs_names` by calling the `list()` function on `names_and_dogs_names`.

Print `list_of_names_and_dogs_names`.

See the code [here](Data%20Scientist%20Career%20Path\3.%20Python%20Fundamentals\5.%20Python%20List\2.%20Combined%20with%20ZIP%20Function\list%20with%20zip%20function.py).

### **e. Python Loop**

<details><summary>Details</summary>

In programming, this process of using an initialization, repetitions, and an ending condition is called a `loop`. In a loop, we perform a process of iteration (repeating tasks).

<p align="center">
  <img src="Data%20Scientist%20Career%20Path\3.%20Python%20Fundamentals\6.%20Python%20Loop\loop.svg">
</p>

Programming languages like Python implement two types of iteration:

- `Indefinite iteration`, where the number of times the loop is executed depends on how many times a condition is met.

- `Definite iteration`, where the number of times the loop will be executed is defined in advance (usually based on the collection size).

### **f. Python Strings**

<details><summary>Details</summary>

In Python, the way we store something like a word, a sentence, or even a whole paragraph is as a string. A string is a sequence of characters contained within a pair of `'single quotes'` or `"double quotes"`. A string can be any length and can contain any letters, numbers, symbols, and spaces.

### **g. Python Dictionaries**

<details><summary>Details</summary>

A dictionary is an unordered set of `key: value` pairs.

It provides us with a way to map pieces of data to each other so that we can quickly find values that are associated with one another.

Suppose we want to store the prices of various items sold at a cafe:

- Avocado Toast is 6 dollars
- Carrot Juice is 5 dollars
- Blueberry Muffin is 2 dollars

In Python, we can create a dictionary called menu to store this data:

```
menu = {"avocado toast": 6, "carrot juice": 5, "blueberry muffin": 2}
```

Notice that:

1. A dictionary begins and ends with curly braces `{` and `}`.
2. Each item consists of a key (`"avocado toast"`) and a value (`6`).
3. Each `key: value` pair is separated by a comma.

It‚Äôs considered good practice to insert a space (` `) after each comma, but our code will still run without the space.

### **i. Python Modules**

<details><summary>Details</summary>

A module is a collection of Python declarations intended broadly to be used as a tool. Modules are also often referred to as ‚Äúlibraries‚Äù or ‚Äúpackages‚Äù ‚Äî a package is really a directory that holds a collection of modules.

Usually, to use a module in a file, the basic syntax you need at the top of that file is:

```
from module_name import object_name
```

Often, a library will include a lot of code that you don‚Äôt need that may slow down your program or conflict with existing code. Because of this, it makes sense to only import what you need.
