## **2. Getting Started with Data Science**

### **a. Introduction to Data Science**

Data science enables us to take data and transform it into meaningful information that can help us make decisions. Data science is interdisciplinary and combines other well-known fields such as probability, statistics, analytics, and computer science. The work that you might do could range from writing up reports to building machine learning models. No matter what your interests are, data science is applicable - because these days, we have data on everything!

</p>

#### **1) Statistics**

A fundamental part of data science is statistics. Statistics is the practice of applying mathematical calculations to sets of data to derive meaning. Statistics can give us a quick summary of a dataset, such as the average amount or how consistent a dataset is.

There are two types of statistics: 

- **Descriptive Statistics**

    Descriptive statistics describe a dataset using mathematically calculated values, such as the mean and standard deviation. For instance, the graph below from [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/heres-what-the-gender-pay-gap-looks-like-by-income-level/) charts the wage gap between American men and women in 2014. An example of a descriptive statistic would be that at the 90th income percentile, women make 80.6% of what men make on average.

- **Inferential Statistics**

    On the other hand, inferential statistics are statistical calculations that enable us to draw conclusions about the larger population. For instance, from looking at the graph we can infer that at the 99th income percentile, women make less than 78% of what men make on average. We can also infer that the reason why the wage gap is smallest at the 10th income percentile is because the minimum wage for men and women is the same.

#### **2) Probability**

Another field that informs the field of data science is probability. Probability is the mathematical study of what could potentially happen. Fun fact: the study of probability came about as a method to decode secret messages.

In data science, probability calculations are used to build models. Models are able to help us understand data that has yet to exist - either data we hadn’t previously collected or data that has yet to be created. Data scientists create models to help calculate the probability of a certain action and then they use that probability to make informed decisions.

[Example of Probability Application](Data%20Scientist%20Career%20Path\2.%20Getting%20Started%20with%20Data%20Science\1.%20Introduction%20to%20Data%20Science\probability.py)

#### **3) Programming**

Given that we’re a “learn to code” website, this one may seem fairly obvious. But in all seriousness, programming is an essential part of data science. It’s also what sets data science apart from similar fields, like data analytics.

Programming is the practice of writing commands for a computer to execute. Computer Science is the discipline of interacting with computation systems.

[Example of Programming Application](Data%20Scientist%20Career%20Path\2.%20Getting%20Started%20with%20Data%20Science\1.%20Introduction%20to%20Data%20Science\programming.py)

#### **4) Domain Expertise**

One of the reasons that data science is one of the most interesting fields to go into is that it doesn’t limit you to a specific industry. Interested in airplanes? Work for a company on ticket pricing! Like fashion? Create a model that predicts the latest trends.

<p align="center">
  <img src="Data%20Scientist%20Career%20Path\2.%20Getting%20Started%20with%20Data%20Science\Domain.svg">
</p>

Domain Expertise refers to the particular set of knowledge that someone cultivates in order to understand their data. You may be able to crunch the numbers, but in order to understand their meaning, you’re going to need a lot of context. Sometimes this context comes from your research, your teammates, or the knowledge that you gain after working in a particular industry.

#### **Review**

Review! You now know the basic parts that make up the field of data science.

- Data Science—the field of taking data and transforming it into meaningful information that can help us make decisions
- Descriptive Statistics—statistics that describe the data in objective terms
- Inferential Statistics—inferences for the overall population based on data
- Probability—the likelihood that an event will happen
- Programming—the act of giving the computer instructions to perform a task
- Domain Expertise—the particular set of knowledge that someone cultivates and brings with them in order to understand their data

</p>

### **c. Data Science Applications**

As you can see, there are many different applications and kinds of projects that you can do once you know a bit of data science!

- Reports - a way of presenting your process, insights, and recommendations
- Recommender Systems - a process that uses data about users and items to predict interest
- Dynamic Pricing - a strategy that takes into account factors such as demand to increase and decrease prices to drive profit
- Natural Language Processing - ways of analyzing text to gain insights as well as support applications, such as chatbots

Of course, there are many applications beyond just the ones that we’ve covered here. So no matter your interest or professional industry, data science thinking can create impact.
